<!-- 
The file user_recommendations.php is responsible for generating personalized suggestions for each user, including properties, rooms, and vehicles. 
It uses the user's geolocation (current location), browser cookies, and PHP sessions to understand their preferences and browsing behavior. 
Based on this data, the system provides the most relevant listings on the “For You” page. 
The script should include user activity tracking, preference detection, location-based recommendations (nearest listings), and optimized database queries to deliver accurate and efficient suggestions.
